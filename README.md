# media-file-sorter
A media file sorter made by using ChatGPT

I had thousands of MP4 files stored on my HDD drive and I wanted to sort it into years and months. This application does exactly that, it loops through all files and sort them into folders, first into years, and then into months.

The code is generated using ChatGPT, there was a few things to correct, but ChatGPT solved it quite well.

* Run the application using "node app" after you've ran "npm i"
* The files you want sorted should be placed in the "source"-folder
* Make sure you have a backup of your files, so run this application with a copy of your files to make sure no loss is made
